# Advent of Code 2017 Challenge

Giving the [Advent of Code 2017 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/2017/about) a shot. Nothing super advanced or fancy here â€” just trying to get in some JS practice and hopefully learn a few new things along the way.

Using Node.js (6.10.1). Calling any day's js file (e.g. `$ node 01/01.js`, etc.) via command line should get the relevant input and spit out the solutions. I stored my input as simple text files.
